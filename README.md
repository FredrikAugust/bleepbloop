# BleepBloop

A simple typescript library to help you build _Neural Networks_.

I am unaware as to whether this works with multiple hidden layers, as I did not have the patience to test it thoroughly. This should therefore not be used when you care about the validity of the results.

## Usage

For example, see bottom of main file. If you want to use the compiled JS instead of TS, run:

    tsc bleepbloop.ts
    
To run this, enter `node bleepbloop.js`.

## Installation

You should only need `typescript` to run this program.
